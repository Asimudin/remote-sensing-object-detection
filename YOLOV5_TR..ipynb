# ==============================================================================
# This version uses YOLOv5's built-in automatic downloader for the COCO128
# sample dataset. This is the most robust and reliable method.

#                      !!! YOU DO NOT NEED AN API KEY !!!
#                      !!! YOU DO NOT NEED TO DOWNLOAD ANYTHING MANUALLY !!!
